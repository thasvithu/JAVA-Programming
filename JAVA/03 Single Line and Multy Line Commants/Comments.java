/*
In Java, comments are used to provide explanations or notes about the code. 
They are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the execution of the program. 
There are two types of comments in Java:
    single-line comments and multi-line comments.

A single-line comment starts with two forward slashes (//) and continues until the end of the line. For example:
*/

//A multi-line comment starts with a forward slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and ends with an asterisk followed by a forward slash (*/).
